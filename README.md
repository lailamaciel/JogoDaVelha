# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in C#

Project developed as part of the Computer Programming course, with the goal of applying fundamental concepts of programming logic, conditional structures, loops, arrays, and code organization in C#.

## 📌 Description

This is a console-based tic-tac-toe game implemented in C# that allows two players to compete. The game automatically checks for win or draw conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C#**
- Suggested IDE: **Visual Studio**
- Environment: **Console Application (.NET)**

- Interactive console interface
- Move validation (prevents overwriting occupied positions)
- Alternates between player X and player O
- Automatic win or draw detection
- Option to restart the game after it ends

## 🧠 Concepts Applied

- Conditional structures (`if`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- 2D arrays
- Methods and modularization
- Structured programming
